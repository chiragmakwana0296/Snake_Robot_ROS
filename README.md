## Snake Robot Based On ROS and V-REP

This Project consist of Design and Development of moduler Snake Robot that uses ROS for robot programming and V-REP for robot simulation.

I have developed verious Kinematic Model for robot locomotion:
1)Serpentine 
2)Side winding -Left. 
3)Side winding -Right.
4)Side winding -Clockwise Rotation.
5)Side winding -Counterclockwise Rotation.
6)Caterpiller Motion.
