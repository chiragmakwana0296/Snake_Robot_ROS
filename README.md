## Snake Robot Based On ROS and V-REP

This is my mini Project consist of Design Development and kinematic modeling of moduler Snake Robot locomotion that uses ROS for robot programming and V-REP for robot simulation. This robot is developed using 10 Servo motors, each joints consist of one servo motor.

Kinematic Model for robot locomotion gaits:
1. Serpentine 
2. Side winding -Left. 
3. Side winding -Right.
4. Side winding -Clockwise Rotation.
5. Side winding -Counterclockwise Rotation.
